## Coroutines

```py
## Coroutines
import asyncio # ğŸ‘ˆ this library is already native since 3.13.5

# ğŸ‘‡"async" always at the beginning
async def get_carrot():
    return "ğŸ¥•"

async def main():
    # --- ğŸ‘‡ "await" your result from the function
    print(await get_carrot()) # You got a ğŸ¥•!
# ğŸ‘‡ Required to start the coroutine
asyncio.run(main())
```

## Task
```py
import asyncio

async def make_hole():
    return "Hole made"

async def main():
    # ------------ ğŸ‘‡ Use it to start a task
    task = asyncio.create_task(make_hole())
    await task # Task done

asyncio.run(main())
```
